== Description ==

>A better WooCommerce experience with a lot of useful extras.

WooCommerce is the most popular eCommerce platform in the world. It is the best eCommerce plugin for WordPress. These are all true, but how can it be better? With CPS | Better WooCommerce plugin you can add small things, that mean a lot! Enhance the overall user experience, get more conversion, increase the total sale and even comply with all the regulations (GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy).

New features are endlessly coming to CPS | Better WooCommerce plugin. Every new feature is disabled by default (this is not Jetpack, pff!) and modules are loading only, when they are active. So this plugin is very optimized and carefully programmed with the best practices.

You can always recommend new features, as this plugin is really for you, WooCommerce users.

#### Tax number field at Checkout

You can show a new Tax number field under Company field on Checkout page. The Tax number field will be shown only, if Company field is not empty. In this case, the Tax number field will be always required. This field value will be saved in customer's profile for future use. Tax number will be displayed in the confirmation emails and on the admin, when you edit the order.

#### Legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, etc.)

**Privacy Policy confirmation checkbox for Registration**

Add an extra checkbox to your registration form. Visitor has to accept your Privacy Policy before registration. This is a must have in the age of personal data protection, controlled by GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, etc.

This field will be saved in profile data. There is also an option to save visitor's actual IP address also. The registration date will also be saved for the customer. These informations will be displayed in the admin and on Account details page, but these fields are not editable.

**Privacy Policy and Terms of Service checkboxes for Checkout**

You can add extra checkboxes to ask for active confirmation from the customer on the Checkout page. There are two checkboxes with custom content and link. These fields are required and will be saved on the order itself. So customers need to accept it on every order, it is not a global profile data.

The two checkboxes are optional to use, so if you need only one checkbox, it can be set also.

**Extra content for Checkout page**

Another option is to add extra content on the Checkout page before and/or after the Place order button. This can be very useful, if your country or any other global rules force to have such required informational messages for your customers.

>**IMPORTANT!** The responsibility of actual legal and personal data protection compliance for any webshop and website is the website's owner's task and duty. Plugin options are supporting these processes and goals, but we, the developers of this plugin don't take any responsibility for your website's legal compliance. Please revise your website with a lawyer!

#### Checkout page customizations

**Conditional display of Company billing fields**

If you enable this option, a new checkbox will be displayed on Checkout page and all Company billing fields (Company name and Tax number) will be displayed only, if checkbox is checked.

**Inline fields to make your order form more compact**

The Company name and Tax number, ZIP and City, Phone and Email fields can be paired and displayed inline next to each other. So your order form will be more compact, taking less space. The fields will be stacked in mobile view.

**Disable unnecessary fields**

Country, State/County and Order notes fields can be hidden, if you don't need them. If Country field is hidden, the Country will be saved with the Country, that you have set in Store Address page under your WooCommerce Settings.

#### Plus/minus quantity buttons

Default field for product quantity is only a number field, but it is not always enough for the visitor. This feature will put plus and minus buttons before and after the number field, so your visitors can easily modify the quantity of the ordered products. The buttons will be displayed on the Product page and on the Cart page also.

IMPORTANT! The display of the buttons depends on the theme and plugins, that you use on your website. In most cases it can be fixed with a little CSS. We are making this plugin compatible with the most popular themes and it has a basic styling to fit for most themes, but it can not fit for all themes. Please let me know if your theme is not compatible, but I can not promise if or when do I fix it for that particular theme.

These themes are supported by default:

- Storefront
- Divi
- Avada

#### Automatic Cart update

There is no need to update cart on Cart page, when customers modify the quantity of any products. With this feature the Cart will be automatically updated after every quantity change.

#### Continue shopping buttons on Cart and/or Checkout pages

Show extra Continue shopping buttons on Cart and/or Checkout pages. The buttons target page is your Shop page. A lot of times, customers are clicking on the Cart, but still want to continue the shopping.

Button positions can be set and custom messages also can be added.

#### Login and registration redirection

Set custom redirection for your registration and/or login, so your customers will land on any desired URL. The registration and login redirect target URLs can be different. On Checkout page, the redirection is not active.

#### Free shipping notification

Show a notification on the Cart page to let your customers know, how much they need to spend to get FREE shipping in your webshop. This is a very effective marketing technique and upsell strategy. Notification text can be edited and translated if you have a multilingual webshop.

#### WPML and Polylang compatibility

The plugin is comaptible with WPML and Polylang plugins, so fields and other texts can be translated by these multilingual plugins.
